c:Write a function to compute the sum from 1 to n of 1/i.
Sure! Below is an R function that computes the sum from 1 to n of 1/i:

```R
# Define the function to compute the sum from 1 to n of 1/i
sum_reciprocals <- function(n) {
  # Initialize the sum to 0
  total_sum <- 0

  # Loop from 1 to n
  for (i in 1:n) {
    # Add 1/i to the total sum
    total_sum <- total_sum + 1/i
  }

  # Return the total sum
  return(total_sum)
}

# Example usage:
n <- 5
result <- sum_reciprocals(n)
print(result)
```

In this function:
- We initialize `total_sum` to 0.
- We use a `for` loop to iterate from 1 to `n`.
- In each iteration, we add `1/i` to `total_sum`.
- Finally, we return the `total_sum`.

You can change the value of `n` to compute the sum for different ranges.
